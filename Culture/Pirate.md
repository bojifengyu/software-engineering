### Pirates can operate when rules and safety nets breakdown

> A pirate can function without a bureaucracy. Pirates support one another and support their leader in the accomplishment of a goal. A pirate can stay creative and on task in a difficult or hostile environment. A pirate can act independently and take intelligent risks, but always within the scope of the greater vision and the needs of the greater team.

> Pirates are more likely to embrace change and challenge convention. “Being aggressive, egocentric, or antisocial makes it easier to ponder ideas in solitude or challenge convention,” says Dean Keith Simonton, a University of California psychology professor and an expert on creativity. “Meanwhile, resistance to change or a willingness to give up easily can derail new initiatives.” So Steve’s message was: if you’re bright, but you prefer the size and structure and traditions of the navy, go join IBM. If you’re bright and think different and are willing to go for it as part of a special, unified, and unconventional team, become a pirate.

__So, what did Steve Jobs’ pirates need to have?__

* It’s not enough to be brilliant and think differently — a pirate has to have the passion, drive and vision to deliver to the customer a game-changing product.
* Will the person you hire, fall in love with your organization and products?
* A pirate is a traveler who comes to you with diverse background and experiences.
* Even though they’re a pirate, they still have to fit into the team and come with or be able to make connections.
