# Cargo cult programming

tl;dr - (over-)applying a design principle blindly without understanding the reasons behind that design principle in the first place. An example would be a novice being taught that commenting code is good, and then adding comments for lines that are self-explanatory or need no comment; other examples involve overly complex use of design patterns or certain obscure forms of coding style and naming conventions.

__key distinction is a clueless imitation of a particular activity (project management philosophy in his very narrow example):__

> During the Second World War, the Americans set up airstrips on various tiny islands in the Pacific.  After the war was over and the Americans went home, the natives did a perfectly sensible thing -- they dressed themselves up as ground traffic controllers and waved those sticks around.  They mistook cause and effect -- they assumed that the guys waving the sticks were the ones making the planes full of supplies appear, and that if only they could get it right, they could pull the same trick.  From our perspective, we know that it's the other way around -- the guys with the sticks are there because the planes need them to land.  No planes, no guys.

> The cargo cultists had the unimportant surface elements right, but did not see enough of the whole picture to succeed. They understood the form but not the content.  There are lots of cargo cult programmers -- __programmers who understand what the code does, but not how it does it.  Therefore, they cannot make meaningful changes to the program.  They tend to proceed by making random changes, testing, and changing again until they manage to come up with something that works.__

1. The most common form of cargo cult programming characterized by the extreme adherence to the form instead of content ( CMM and, to a lesser extent,  extreme programming  are good examples). 
2. Another form is closely connected with outsourcing and related communication problems. This variant of cargo cult programming often includes absurd  "to the word" following of the specification even if it contains blunders and/or was completely detached from reality.
3. The ritual usage of fashionable technologies like OO ten years ago are a third popular form and actually is the mildest cases of the same (is not OO good in all cases ? ;-).  OO fundamentalists made cargo cult programming almost an art form. Much of a typical university textbooks expose student not to programming methodology but to some fake concepts fashionable for the last two-three years.
4. Rare and extreme cases include debugging without understanding underling language. One such case was described by Weinberg.

When used knowledgeably, either development style can produce high quality software economically and quickly. But both development styles have pathological lookalikes that don’t work nearly as well, and that can be difficult to distinguish from the genuine articles.

The process-imposter organization bases its practices on a slavish devotion to process for process’s sake.

Their misuse of process is demotivating, which hurts productivity. And they’re not very enjoyable to work for.

The commitment-imposter organization focuses primarily on motivating people to work long hours

"Doing the same thing again and again and expecting different results is a sign of insanity," the old saying goes. It’s also a sign of cargo cult software engineering.

The fact that both process-oriented and commitment-oriented projects have pathological lookalikes has muddied the debate.

__competence ultimately determines whether a project succeeds or fails, regardless of the development approach taken__
