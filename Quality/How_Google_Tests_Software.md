* The only way a team can write quality software is when the entire team is responsible for quality. ie. PM, Dev, Testers... everyone. Make testing a feature of the code base.

* "Engineering Productivity" has to overcome bias against testing and a company culture that favored heroic effort over engineering rigor.

* Testing must not create friction that slows down innovation and development.

* Google engineers prefer quality over features.

* Get it right from the beginning or you've created a permanent mess.

* "You build it, you break it"

* A large part of productivity is avoiding re-work because of sloppy development.

Code review:
Review designs, code quality and risk. Refactor code to make it more testable.
