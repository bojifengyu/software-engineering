It is a **strategy** and **process** (not a product) directed toward making and selling a product to customers.
- minimum is focusing on early adopters.
- viable is focusing on validating the question we're trying to learn.
- product can be static page (marketing a product) or functional features (measure adoption)
----------
The process is iterated until a desirable product-market fit is obtained, or until the product is deemed to be non-viable.

- avoid building product that nobody wants
- maximize learning per dollar spent
- learn on early customers.
- minimize the build/measure/learn loop (think/make/check UX loop)
- validate assumptions

1. Questions need to be answered and Assumptions.
2. Minimum effort required to answer the assumption.

"dominant reason for not releasing sooner was a reluctance to trade the dream of success for the reality of feedback"

===================================================================

Decisions:
- value to customer (what is our customer valuing)
  - features
- quality
- engineering effort (schedule + risk)


desirability
business viability
engineering effort

theory of constraints - focus on total cycle time, not just implementation.

queue size, batch size
variability

Apple vs Lean
- highly focused on desirability, simplicity = leave out features that is not most important
  ie. still minimum features of high quality.

MVP vs MDP

local maximum
greatest risk is taking no risk at all.
