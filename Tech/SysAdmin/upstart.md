_It handles asynchronicity by emitting events._
_Upstart emits "events" which services can register an interest in. When an event -- or combination of events -- is emitted that satisfies some service's requirements, Upstart will automatically start or stop that service. If multiple jobs have the same "start on" condition, Upstart will start those jobs ''in parallel''_

`/etc/init.d` System V init tools (SysVinit).
It contains the `init` program (the first process that is run when the kernel has finished initializingÂ¹) as well as some infrastructure to start and stop services and configure them

Files in the directory are shell scripts that respond to start, stop, restart.
