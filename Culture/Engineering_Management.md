### 1. Hiring

Hiring is a function requiring cooperation from multiple departments and consists of multiple phases; roughly speaking: sourcing, screening, interviewing, deciding, offer-making, and closing. At each stage this means making the relevant actions the top priority of the responsible actor, e.g. it means that recruiters contact a lead immediately, and schedule an interview or follow-up conversations to occur at the first humanly-possible time slot. It means that doing an interview takes priority over other work.

The quality of coworkers is the single greatest determinant of workplace happiness, and fully engaged participation by everyone is the primary way by which everyone exercises direct power over making their job experience better. 

### 2. Let process be implemented by those who practice it

At various times I've been involved in the due diligence process of potential acquisition targets. One of the most surprising findings was that in many cases, a company that was smaller than us had more formal processes, and this was cited by its own people as a major factor as to why they moved more slowly than we did, executed on fewer ideas, and ultimately ended up in a weaker market position than we were (which was sometimes why we were considering the acqusition). 

introducing process typically went "new process is reluctantly introduced only right before the point where things tip into chaos." Push this point as far as humanly possible, and then some, because what you receive in return is high organizational speed.

### 3. Promotion from within

1) Hiring managers or executives is inherently very risky. 

2) There is a very high probability that an externally-sourced manager will slow you down. 

1) Source management candidates who are willing to join as individual contributors. While the company remains below a certain size, it's is eminently possible for highly talented technology managers to join as individual contributors and rapidly rise into positions of leadership, and they should be encouraged to do so.

2) Using either the few experienced managers you've been able to internally promote or failing that, outside executive coaches, intensely mentor your more inexperienced managers to develop their skills. Typically, because many of your management candidates were less than fully-qualified, they will demonstrate potential but still be unsure in their new roles. Until they are comfortable and practiced in their roles, both they, their peers, and their teams will exist in a state of some distress. 

> difference between people who joined Netscape in "the early days" vs those who joined later. The early people joined "to make the company great," while those who joined later did so "because the company was great" and, he felt, this was key to the later lackluster performance of the company. 

### 4. Tools are top priority

The core premise of any technology-driven company is that it is providing a tool that makes human life better, faster, more effective. Driving the effectiveness of that company and especially its own technology operations is the effectiveness of its tools. 

If your culture reflects this priority, you'll have no problem getting your best engineers to work on improving tools. The best engineers tend to go where they have the greatest impact. 

### 5. Technical Leaders

All external management hires must be able to write code and show a high level of technical proficiency, up to and including the head of the technical department. If the company is a technology company, this should also include the CEO. 

Candidates who cannot pass these tests or who don't have a verifiable record of public technical work should not be hired. 

At companies other than Facebook, I have witnessed more than one large system failure that stemmed from a lack of core technical literacy in the executive staff. At Facebook, individual technical competence happens to be required of all engineering management staff and extends all the way up to the head of the department and includes the CEO (who continues to participate in Hackathons). This allows the company to repeatedly take daring technical risks in order to achieve significantly innovative product goals and execute at a consistently rapid pace: the more you understand the rules of the game, the better you can play it. 

### Scaling teams

* Dedicate engineering resources toward shared tools and abstractions.
* Invest in reusable training materials to onboard new engineers.
* Standardize on coding conventions.
* Increase code quality through code reviews.
* Having the right data (and lots of it) solves many problems.
* Automate testing to scale your code.
