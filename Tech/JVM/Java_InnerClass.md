* Nested Inner class can access any private instance variable of outer class.
* We can’t have static method in a nested inner class because an inner class is implicitly associated with an object of its outer class.
* Inner class can be declared within a method of an outer class. Method Local inner classes can’t use local variable of outer method until that local variable is not declared as final.
* Static nested classes are not technically an inner class. They are like a static member of outer class.
* Anonymous inner classes are declared without any name at all.
