__Make people responsible for the consequences of their actions.__

> build reliable software that can be continuous deployed to an unreliable platform that scales horizontally. They need to be able to self-service environments and deployments. They need to understand how to write testable, maintainable code. They need to know how to do packaging, deployment, and post-deployment support.

Hereâ€™s what the devops team does in this model:
- Builds a platform that allows developers to self-service environments for testing and production (and deployments to those environments) and provides metrics to the organization as a whole. This platform is a product, and the team that builds it is doing product development, which (in particular) means the people who use the platform are your customers.
- Provides a toolchain that developers can use to build, test, deploy and run their systems.
- Coaches teams working to move to this model and provides support and training for the platform and toolchain.
