### Peak velocity

* Model S-curve onto new project to predict velocity
* Scope creep / Dark matter 50% (depends on complexity and expertise)

### Lead Time VS Cycle Time

Lead time clock starts when the request is made and ends at delivery. Cycle time clock starts when work begins on the request and ends when the item is ready for delivery. Cycle time is a more mechanical measure of process capability. Lead time is what the customer sees.

Treat avg lead time as fixed variable, from past data.

### Staffing using Little's Law

* Velocity = WIP / Lead Time

i.e. # of engineers required = Velocity * Lead Time

### Allocate capacity

* Identify Classes of Service, allocate in order to deliver against anticipated demand.

e.g. 
* Expedite
* Standing Feature
* Fixed Date

### Ninety-Ninety rule

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule

> "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time."[1]

â€”Tom Cargill, Bell Labs
