### Continuous Discovery

1. Delivery: building of a software product. Analysis, design, coding, testing, documentingâ€¦ This side is visible.

2. Discovery: learning about the outside world and our product in it. Understanding the world, understanding the product, what problems it solves, what value it provides and how it fits in the word. Understanding customers, market, competition, users. Prototype and validate user experience, create UI, validate working software.

Balance Delivery with Discovery - Dual-Track Agile. http://www.svpg.com/dual-track-scrum/

Prototype from Discovery serves as a spec for Delivery.

Focus on delivering value to customers, not throughput of stories.
