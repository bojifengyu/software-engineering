Create the most efficient path from hypothesis to continuous feedback:

* Start with a minimum viable product (MVP).
* Measure the value of your features.
* Perform just enough analysis up front.
* Do less. (Stories should always be small vertical slices.)
* Include feature toggles in your stories.
