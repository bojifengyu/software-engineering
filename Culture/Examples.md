__"Good Engineer Culture"__

http://www.theeffectiveengineer.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-engineering-culture

* Optimize for iteration speed.
* Push relentlessly toward automation.
* Build the right software abstractions.
* Develop a focus on high code quality with code reviews. 
* Maintain a respectful work environment.
* Build shared ownership of code.
* Invest in automated testing.
* Allot 20% time.
* Build a culture of learning and continuous improvement.
* Hire the best.

> Ooyala, in its very early startup days, used to optimize for cranking out as many features as possible, with an absence of code reviews; the result was that while the initial product may have gone to market more quickly, the resultant code became painful to modify, and __we spent over a year just rewriting brittle code to eliminate technical debt__.

> One mistake that many engineering organizations make too early on is dividing the entire team into subteams with tech leads when the team’s still small. Subteams build walls of ownership that reduce incentive to cross those walls, since individuals will likely be assessed by their subteam’s objectives.

Some things I believe: [Coda Hale](http://codahale.com/about.html)

* While HTTP isn’t always the best answer, it’s a damn fine first guess.
* You can’t do much without measuring.
* Writing tests for your code may not reduce the number of bugs, but it will make fixing the bugs you inevitably find easier.
* If a problem is worth solving, it’s worth solving well and once.
* Incurious people terrify me.
* There is no such thing as untestable code.
* Over-attachment to tools is dysfunctional–don’t mistake what the tool allows you to do with the tool itself.
Mornings require some Sightglass coffee.
* The internal components of your software should exhibit the same grace and utility as the external components–looking under the hood should be delightful, not horrifying.
* Bicycles should come stock with fenders, racks, lights, and nice fat tires.

__Trying to change company culture is a fool’s errand__

* A simple example of a system condition is lighting.
* Bonus systems are a strong culture generator. 
* Open offices enhance communication, but decrease concentration. It’s a choice we have to make and hopefully we do it while cognizant of its effects on company culture.
* All company policies and organizational structures are system conditions that act as culture generators. They are the recipe. To change company culture, we must change the system conditions.
