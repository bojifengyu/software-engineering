Some things I believe: [Coda Hale](http://codahale.com/about.html)

* While HTTP isn’t always the best answer, it’s a damn fine first guess.
* You can’t do much without measuring.
* Writing tests for your code may not reduce the number of bugs, but it will make fixing the bugs you inevitably find easier.
* If a problem is worth solving, it’s worth solving well and once.
* Incurious people terrify me.
* There is no such thing as untestable code.
* Over-attachment to tools is dysfunctional–don’t mistake what the tool allows you to do with the tool itself.
Mornings require some Sightglass coffee.
* The internal components of your software should exhibit the same grace and utility as the external components–looking under the hood should be delightful, not horrifying.
* Bicycles should come stock with fenders, racks, lights, and nice fat tires.
