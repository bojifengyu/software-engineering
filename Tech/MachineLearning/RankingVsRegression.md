# Combined Regression and Ranking

http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1835928

regression based metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, which reward a model for predicting a numerical value y′.

rank-based metrics, such as Area under the ROC curve (AUC), which reward a model for producing predicted values with the same pairwise or- dering y1′ > y2′ as the true values y1 > y2 for a pair of given examples.

CTR prediction must be performed with both ranking and regression performance in mind.
