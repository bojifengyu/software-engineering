Who is right? We can find out by quantifying the overall economic impact.Read more at location 571   

Lean manufacturing experts classify testing as a form of necessary waste, not as a value-added activity. Would an economist view testing this way? Not if testing increases the economic value of the work product.Read more at location 627   

Reducing risk, which is the primary mission of testing, clearly creates economic value for product developers.Read more at location 633   

If our answers were highly sensitive to noisy assumptions, our economic framework would be much less useful.Read more at location 676   

Opportunities get smaller with time, and obstacles get larger. The longer we wait to exploit an opportunity or to deal with an obstacle, the less economic value is available.Read more at location 722   

Every engineer is permitted to buy up to 4 weeks of schedule improvement,Read more at location 754   
at a cost of no higher than $500 per week. Their manager has higher authority limits, and the director has even more authority.Read more at location 754   

Managing the process upstream of the bottleneck is a valuable tool for improving flow at the bottleneck.Read more at location 1155   

In product development, the situation is quite different. Our jobs have different delay costs, and they block resources for differing amounts of time. As a result, we can create value with a thoughtful queueing discipline.Read more at location 1188   

Therefore, it is critical that we react quickly to emerging queues. If a queue is allowed to persist, it does much more economic damage.Read more at location 1322   

The economics of each discrete choice depend on two factors: the probability function and the payoff-function.Read more at location 1434   

Whenever the area on the left side of the curve increases faster than the area on the right side, stop increasing variability.Read more at location 1496   

The Principle of Optimum Failure Rate: Fifty percent failure rate is usually optimum for generating information.Read more at location 1498   

validation testing, which should be optimized for high success rates.Read more at location 1522   

Granular estimates produce good estimates of aggregate scope, but we should never schedule tasks at this level of detail. Instead, it makes more sense to aggregate many small tasks and to schedule them as a group. Aggregation pools variability and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of our estimates.Read more at location 1555   

Some companies limit new products to three major improvements.Read more at location 2130   

The first three are demand-focused. They involve blocking new demand, shedding existing projects, and shedding features. The next five approaches are supply-focused. They involve pulling resources, using part-timers, using specialists, creating T-shaped resources, and cross-training workers at adjacent processes.Read more at location 2355   

Zombie projects destroy flow. Kill the zombies!Read more at location 2380   

The Principle of T-Shaped Resources: Develop people who are deep in one area and broad in many.Read more at location 2434   

It is best to process outliers systematically, using an escalation process.Read more at location 2499   

it can make economic sense to subdivide the workstream into categories with different quality of service goals.Read more at location 2528   

strategy should focus on reacting most quickly to problems that age poorly.Read more at location 3777   

centralizing resources increases response time.Read more at location 3790   

Triage works whenever we have sufficient information to make good judgments at the intake point.Read more at location 3807   

We automatically escalate the priority of a job when it has waited too long in queue.Read more at location 3814
