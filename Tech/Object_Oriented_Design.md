* Depend on behaviour, not data
* Single Responsibility, isolate extra responsibility, and dependencies.
* Control the dependency direction. Depend on things that change less often than you do.
* Dependency injection.
* Ask, don't tell.
* Hook methods allow subclass to contribute specializations.
* honor the contract - don't change the subclass interfaces - Liskov Substitution Principle.
* template method pattern
* shallow hierachies
* use modules for role extension.
* Duck Typing: behaves-like-a relationship - by behaviour instead of by class type.
* inheritance: is-a relationship
* composition: has-a relationship

__Design Goal: Cheaply Reduce Coupling__
http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/blog/?p=104

Coupling measures the spread of a change across elements. Cohesion measures the cost of a change within an element. An element is cohesive to the degree that the entire element changes when the system needs to change.

If one element can be insulated from a likely change in another at reasonable cost, then itâ€™s worth doing sooner rather than later. Breaking other forms of coupling will be more expensive and might be better defered until just before a triggering change.
