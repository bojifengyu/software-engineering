[Kent Beck on TDD @ Quora](https://www.quora.com/In-Test-Driven-Development-how-do-unit-tests-help-drive-good-design/answer/Kent-Beck?srid=Vih&share=1)

TDD doesn't drive good design. TDD gives you immediate feedback about what is likely to be bad design. If a test is hard to write, if a test is non-deterministic, if a test is slow, then something is wrong with the design. When I'm not ready to make good design decisions, I still don't end up with a good design, but I certainly know I have room for improvement.
